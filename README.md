## Devlogs
### W1
Components are the lego pieces, gameobjects are the complete lego buildings, 
and scenes are the towns where I place those buildings.

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

1. Becuase r,g,b represents the color values that are between 0~1, which only can be represented with floats.
2. Logically the number ball bounced should be represented in natural number (int)
3. Every line of the code should be end with the semicolon.
